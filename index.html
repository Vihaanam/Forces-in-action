            <p>Forces are pushes or pulls that are measured in newtons. Here are what forces can do:<br><br></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make an object move. For example: we pedal and so the bicycle moves.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li>Make a moving object stop. For example: we press the brakes to stop a moving car.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li>Change the speed of a moving object. For example: we kick a ball and so it moves faster.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li>Change the direction of a moving object. For example: in badminton, we change the direction in which the shuttle cock is coming.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li>Change the shape of an object. For example: we mold clay into different shapes by applying force.</li>
                <br>

            <p>Introduction:<br><br></p>
            <ul class="intro">
                <li>The Earth and all objects are pulled towards each other.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li>Gravitational attraction causes objects to have weight.</li>
                <br>
                <img height="150" src="https://k8schoollessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/weight-earth-vs-moon.jpg">
                <br>
                <li>Weight is a force.</li>

            <br>
            <p>Gravity:<br><br>Gravity is the force that keeps your feet on the ground and the atmosphere in place. If there was no gravity, everything, including the air we breathe, would fly of into space. The force that makes things fall to the ground on Earth is called gravity. Gravity also holds Earth ond the other planets in their orbits around the Sun. The size of the force of gravity depends on the object's mass (the amount of matter it contains) and its distance from the object it's attracting. Gravity pulls down on everything - solids, liquids or gases - and gives them a force called weight. The force of gravity also exists on the moon but it is not as strong as it is on the Earth. This is because the moon is much smaller than the Earth.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Mass and weight:<br><br>The mass of an object is how much matter it contains. It is measured in grams (g) and kilograms (kg) but is NOT a force. The weight of on object is the force caused by gravity pulling down on the mass of an object. It is measured in newtons (N). One newton is about the force you would need to pick up an average-sized apple. Ten newtons are roughly the force you would need to lift 1 kg. A forcemeter measures force. Hook an object onto the spring. Gravity pulls down the object. The force of the pull of gravity on the object stretches the spring and the force in newtons can be read on the scale. Weight is measured in newtons using a forcemeter. Mass is a measure of how much matter something has - we measure mass in grams and kilograms using a balance.</p>
